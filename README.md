# The SMRK Hamiltonian for General L-Functions  
### Spectral Arithmetic Dynamics Beyond ζ(s)

## Overview

This document extends the SMRK spectral framework from the Riemann zeta function
to **general L-functions**, including Dirichlet and automorphic cases.

The emphasis is universality and structural stability.

---

## Key Achievements

- Definition of arithmetic Hilbert spaces with internal degrees of freedom
- Prime-shift operators with local Euler data
- Generalized von Mangoldt functions
- Universal renormalization
- Explicit formulas for general L-functions
- Interpretation of functional equations as gauge symmetry

---

## Conceptual Message

The SMRK framework is **not zeta-specific**.

Its core mechanisms:
- prime locality
- trace duality
- renormalization
are universal across the L-function landscape.

---

## What Is Not Claimed

- No proof of GRH
- No spectral completeness claims
- No Langlands equivalence

---

## Status

**Structural generalization + testable framework.**

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Extends:
  - SMRK Hamiltonian
  - Trace constructions
- Interfaces with:
  - Dirichlet and automorphic theories
  - Broader arithmetic programs

---

## Intended Audience

- Number theorists
- Researchers in automorphic forms
- Mathematical physicists
